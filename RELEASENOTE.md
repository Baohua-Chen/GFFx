# GFFx v0.4.0 Release Notes

Added two useful functionalities: `coverage` for calculating breadth of coverage and `depth` for calculating depth of coverage from BAM/SAM/CRAM or BED files on a GFF file.

Added a `sample` functionality for random downsampling of feature groups from each chromosome at equal ratios.

Updated module organization and source code directory layout to conform to the Rust 2024 edition guidelines for module visibility (`pub`) and path imports.
